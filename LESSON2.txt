<ul class="custom-font"><strong>Structure of CSS</strong>

<h2 class="pe">Selector</h2>
<ul>
<li>the HTML element you want to style; is a
 pattern used to "find" or "select" the HTML
 elements on a webpage to which a set of
 CSS rules will be applied.</li>
</ul>

<h2 class="pe">Property</h2>
<ul>
<li>the style attribute you want to modify; is a
 named characteristic or attribute that
 defines a specific aspect of how an HTML
 element should be displayed or rendered by
 the browser. Properties are used within
 CSS declarations to apply styles to selected
 elements.</li>
</ul>



<h2 class="pe">Value</h2>
<ul>
<li>the weight of the attribute you want to apply to the
 element property; is the specific setting or
 configuration assigned to a CSS property. A property
 and its value form a CSS declaration, which dictates
 how an element should be styled</li>
<ul>


<h2 class="pe">Declaration</h2>
<ul>
<li>is a single instruction that defines a specific
 style for am element</li>
</ul>




<h2 class="pe">Declaration block</h2>
<ul>
<li>fundamental part of a CSS rule. It is a
block of code that contains one or more CSS declarations,
which define the styling rules for the selected HTML
element(s).</li>
</ul>




<h2 class="pe">The Style Sheet and its Parts</h2>
<ul>
<li>A set of instructions to a Web browser on how to
 display various elements on a Web page is known as
 style sheet</li>

<li>Every CSS (whether it is contained in a .css file, or
 embedded in the head element of an HTML
 document) is a series of instructions called
 statements</li>

</ul>

<h2 class="pe">How Do Style Sheet Work?</h2>
<ul>
<li>Style sheets are just text files, or text embedded in the
 head of an HTML document, that help separate
 content from appearance. The content of the page goes
 into an HTML file. And the appearance goes into a
 style sheet. But how does all this end up as a web
 page in the reader’s browser?</li>

<li>A style sheet suggests the browser to
display a page in a particular way, how the
pages should be displayed in the browser.</li>
</ul>


<h1 class="pe">Three Kinds of CSS</h1>

<h2 class="pe">External Style Sheets</h2>
<ul>
<li>the most global of the three kinds of CSS because you
can apply the same one to an unlimited number of
pages</li>
<li>allows you to develop a consistent style across pages</li>
<li>easily allow you to change the layout of your entire
web site by simply changing the external style sheet
and every page is instantly updated</li>
<li> has a .css file extension </li>
</ul>
<h2 class="pe">Embedded Style Sheets (Internal Style Sheets)</h2>

<ul class="custom-font"><strong>used for creating a document-wide style rule</strong>
<li>placed within an HTML document, between the
<head> and </head><?li>
<li>used when you have a page that you want to present
in a different style from other pages</li>
<li>embedded style sheets override external style sheets.</li>
</ul>

<h2 class="pe">Inline Style Sheets</h2>


<ul class="custom-font"> <strong>used for isolated changes to a headline, paragraph,
picture or other element</strong>
<li>stored directly in the style attributes of the HTML tags</li>
<li>inline style sheets override external and embedded
style sheets</li>


<h2 class="pe">Inline Style Sheet</h2>

<p>We can define the style for a single element
using the style attribute. There are various
tags that have the style attribute that would
represent its value.</p>



<h2 class="pe">Embedded Style SheetM</h2>

<p>Embedded styles or Internal style sheets are
defined by the container tag <style></style> and
placed within the head part of the HTML file. It
provides style to the whole HTML file.</p>

<h2 class="pe">Linked Style Sheets</h2>

<ul class="custom-font"><strong>External style sheets or linked styles are made outside
the HTML file.</strong>
<li>An external style sheet is linked via <link>. The
<link> element allows you to establish document
relationships.</li>
<li>The <link> element tells the browser to find the
specific style sheet.</li>
<li>The <link> element can ONLY be used within the
<head></head> section of the document.</li>
<li>The style sheet file does not contain ANY html code; it
contains only style rules.</li>
<li>A CSS file (filename.css) is a style sheet that does not
contain anything but the styles.</li>
<li>In order for it to take effect, it needs to be linked.</li>
<li>A linked file is simply just like embedded styles but
without all the HTML tags.</li>
<li> Can be written in any text editor and saved with a
filename extension of .css.</li>
<li>Using the external/linked style sheets, we can modify
web pages by just changing one CSS file.</li>
</ul>
<h2 class="pe">Creating an External CSS file</h2>

<ol class="custom-font"><strong>The following steps will show how to
create and test a basic style sheet.</strong>
<li> Open a blank document in
Notepad.</li>
<li>Type the style you want to define.</li>
<li> On the Menu bar, click File and
click Save.</li>
<li>Type your filename with the
extension .css and change the file
type to All Files.</li>
</ol>
<h2 class="pe">Linking CSS file to HTML file</h2>
<ol>
<li>After creating your CSS file, open your HTML
file.</li>
<li>Type the following inside the HTML file:
 <link rel=“stylesheet” href=“sample.css”
 type=“text/css”>.</li>
<li>Save your HTML file.</li>
</ol>
<h2 class="pe">CSS Comments</h2>

<p>Comments are used to explain the code, and will
help you edit the source code on a later date.
Comments are ignored by the browsers, therefore
you can place notifications, reminders and help
you increase code readability. A CSS comment
starts with /* and ends with */. Comments can
also span multiple lines.</p>

<p class="custom-font">
I learned that inline styles are written directly in the HTML element, making them useful for quick, one-time styling. Embedded stylesheets are placed inside the <style> tag within the HTML file, allowing you to style multiple elements in the same page. External stylesheets are separate CSS files linked to the HTML, which helps keep the code organized and makes it easier to style multiple pages consistently.
