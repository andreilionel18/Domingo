<h2 class="pe">Setting Dimensions
</h2>
<p class="buddy">
CSS can be used to manage dimensions such as
visibility, width or height of HTML elements.
</p>

<h1 class="pe">Property for Dimension
s</h1>

<h2 class="pe">visibility:</h2>
<p class="buddy">
visible – 
default value, the value is
visible
</p>


<h2 class="pe">visibility hidden</h2>
<p class="buddy">
 The element is hidden (but
still takes up space)


<h2 class="pe">visibility collapse</h2>
<p class="buddy">
Only for table rows (<tr>),
row groups (<tbody>), columns (<col>),
column groups (<colgroup>), and flex items.
This value removes a row or column as if
display: none where used.
If collapse is used on other elements, it
renders as "hidden"
</p>


<h2 class="pe">width</h2> 
<p class="buddy">
Indicates the width 
</p>

<h2 class="pe">height</h2>
<p class="buddy">
Indicates the height 
</p>

<h2 class="pe">line-height</h2> 
<p class="buddy">
Indicates the line spacing 
</p>

<h2 class="pe">max-height</h2>
<p class="buddy">
Indicates the maximum
height 
</p>

<h2 class="pe">Pseudo-Classes and Links
</h2>

<p class="buddy">
Recall that classes are user-defined selectors that
can be used to control individual HTML element
formatting.
• Pseudo-classes are defined by a colon and are not
user-defined. Specific pseudo-classes can be used
on specific HTML elements only.
• The anchor element has four pseudo-classes: link,
visited, hover and active. Each one affects the
behavior of the anchor element.
</p>

<p class="buddy">
The link pseudo-class is for hyperlinks that have
NOT yet visited.
• The visited pseudo-class is for visited hyperlinks.
• The hover pseudo-class is for hyperlinks when the
mouse is hovered over them.
• The active pseudo-class is for hyperlinks when
they are clicked.
</p>

<h2 class="pe">Pseudo-Classes and Links Property & Syntax
</h2>
<p class="buddy">
The order in which the pseudo-classes are stated is
important.
• Take note of the LVHA or Link, Visited, Hover,
Active is the order of the pseudo-classes.
Note: The value that you place inside {…} will be
displayed whenever a pseudo-class property is
performed. You can set the color of the text or
element, its background, its decoration and many
other characters.
</p>

<p class="buddy">
• Be reminded that the hover property should be
placed after the link property for it to function
properly.
• Pseudo-classes can also be used on any element or
block elements on the web page, especially the hover
property, so that, whenever one hovers over an
image, paragraph or any element, you can set
properties to make it more interactive. Example is
changing the font color, setting a background,
border and many other properties.

<p class="buddy">
I’ve learned that setting dimensions in CSS is important for controlling the size and layout of elements on a webpage. By using properties like width, height, max-width, and min-height, we can make sure that each element fits properly within the design. It also helps create balance and structure, making the webpage look neat and responsive on different devices. Understanding how to set dimensions taught me how small adjustments can greatly improve the overall appearance and user experience of a website.
