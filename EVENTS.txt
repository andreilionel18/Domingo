During the Buwan ng Wika celebration, the most important thing I learned was to value the Filipino language as a symbol of our unity and national identity. I realized that by using and enriching our own language, we show love and respect for our culture. I can apply this in real life by speaking and writing in Filipino with pride and confidence. I actively participated in the event by joining contests and helping in activities that promote our language and culture. If I were to teach this to a classmate, I would explain that language is not only a means of communication but also a bridge that connects us as Filipinos. Events like this are important because they help students appreciate culture, develop discipline, and encourage active participation in school activities.

During the Intramurals, the most important thing I learned was the value of teamwork, sportsmanship, and discipline. I realized that winning is not the only goal, but also learning how to cooperate, respect others, and enjoy the experience. I can apply what I learned in real life by working well with others, staying humble in victory, and being strong in defeat. I actively participated in the event by joining games and supporting my team with enthusiasm and respect. If I were to teach this to a classmate, I would explain that Intrams is not just about sports, but also about building character and unity. Having events like this is important because they promote physical fitness, strengthen friendships, and teach valuable life lessons beyond the classroom.

During the Science Month celebration, the most important thing I learned was how science helps us understand the world and improve our daily lives. I realized that science is not just about experiments and formulas, but about curiosity, discovery, and innovation. I can apply what I learned in real life by being more observant, asking questions, and finding solutions to everyday problems using scientific thinking. I actively participated in the event by joining activities and supporting projects that promote awareness and love for science. If I were to teach this to a classmate, I would explain that science encourages us to explore and think critically about how things work. Having events like Science Month is important because it inspires students to appreciate the role of science in shaping a better and more sustainable future.
