<h2 class="pe">Display Property
</h2>
<p>
CSS display property allows you to control how an
element is displayed.
</p>



<h2 class="pe">KINDS OF ELEMENTS IN CSS</h2>
<ul>
<li>Block level
elements </li>
<li>Inline level
elements </li>
<h1 class="heading">Block Level Element</h1>
<p class="custom-font">
Block level elements take up as much space as possible by
default. Each block level element will start a new line on the
page, stacking down the page. In addition to stacking vertically,
block level elements will also take up as much horizontal space
as possible.
</p>

<h2 class="pe">Inline Level Element
</h2>

<p class="custom-font">
Inline elements display in a line.
They do not force the text after them to a new line.
An anchor (or link) is an example of an inline element.
You can put several links in a row, and they will display in a
line.

<h2 class="pe">Why is this important?
</h2>
<p class="custom-font">
How an element behaves when styled with CSS will
change based on the display mode of an element
(block vs. inline). Some CSS properties react
differently for each display type. We'll learn more
about this behavior when we start to lay out pages in
CSS.
</p>


<h2 class="pe">Div Tag
</h2>
<p class="custom-font">

Div divides the contents of a web page into individual
sections.
• Div tag allows you to apply styles to different sections of your
webpage.
• It is a generic way of adding structure to an HTML document.
• Div tag is a block level element and is therefore, usually
applied to block HTML and should not be used within a
paragraph.
• In most web browsers, a div tag will provide line spacing
before and after a block element.
</p>

<h2 class="pe">Span Tag
</h2>
<p class="custom-font">
Span tag is a generic way of adding structure to an HTML
document.
• Span is applied to an inline element.
• It is used to emphasize words or sentences within a
paragraph.
</p>


<h2 class="pe">Span and Div Tags
</h2>
<p class="custom-font">
Span and Div tags do not have default styling information.
• Changing the style or formatting of the line or block covered
by the tag, you need to specify an attribute to affect the
desired style.
• Most HTML tags apply formatting just like tags for headings,
lists and others, but there are some that do not have any
specific effect, namely the container tags <span></span> and
<div></div> but are actually used quite extensively in
conjunction with CSS.
</p>

<p class="custom-font">

Simply put, span and div tags are just used to format a part
of the content by usually using CSS.
• The general difference between <span></span> and
<div></div> is that <div></div> has line breaks before and
after it.
• Usually the <span></span> is used for small chunks of code
while <div></div> is for larger ones.

<p class="custom-font">
I’ve learned that stylesheets in CSS play an important role in controlling how a webpage looks and feels. There are three main types: inline, internal (embedded), and external stylesheets. Inline styles apply directly to a single element, internal styles affect one webpage, and external stylesheets can style multiple pages at once. Understanding these helped me see how organization and efficiency matter in web design—using the right type of stylesheet can make a website easier to maintain and more consistent in style.
